### 📌 Problem Statement

**Design a Landing Page Builder Specifically for Internal Product Launches**

Companies often need quick, professional-looking landing pages to announce new features, internal demos, stakeholder updates, and beta testing opportunities — all without involving designers or devops for every update. This tool solves that.

---

### ✅ Solution Overview

This tool is a lightweight **drag-and-drop landing page builder** designed for **internal launches** within teams or organizations.

🔧 Key Features:

* 🧱 **Template-based builder**: Start from pre-defined launch templates like:

  * Beta Testing
  * Internal Demo
  * Stakeholder Update
  * Feature Release
  * Maintenance Notification
  * Alpha Launch
  * Blank Template (fully customizable)

* 📦 **Drag & Drop Upload**: Attach product images or logos for quick previews.

* ⚡ **Fast Setup**: Built for teams to create pages in minutes without waiting on design or deployment pipelines.

### 🧪 How It Works

1. **User logs in** via a fake login screen (can simulate any identity).
2. **User uploads** a product image or logo via drag-and-drop.
3. **User selects a template**, which routes to a launch-ready landing page.
4. Optionally, **user can choose a blank template** and customize from scratch.
